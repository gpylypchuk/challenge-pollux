# Security Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures and best practices implemented in the Wallet Manager application. The application handles sensitive cryptocurrency data and must maintain high security standards.

## Key Security Features

### 1. Private Key Management

- Private keys are never stored in plain text
- AES-256-GCM encryption for private key storage
- Keys are encrypted at rest and in transit
- Private keys are only decrypted when necessary for transactions

### 2. Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session management and timeout
- Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks

### 3. Data Protection

- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection
- Secure headers configuration

### 4. Network Security

- HTTPS/TLS encryption
- WebSocket security
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting
- IP whitelisting (optional)

## Implementation Details

### Private Key Encryption

```typescript
// Example of private key encryption
const encryptData = (data: string): { encryptedData: string; iv: string } => {
  const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16);
  const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv(
    "aes-256-gcm",
    Buffer.from(process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY),
    iv
  );
  let encrypted = cipher.update(data, "utf8", "hex");
  encrypted += cipher.final("hex");
  const authTag = cipher.getAuthTag();
  return {
    encryptedData: encrypted + authTag.toString("hex"),
    iv: iv.toString("hex"),
  };
};
```

### Authentication Flow

1. User login with credentials
2. Server validates credentials
3. JWT token generated with claims
4. Token stored securely (HttpOnly cookie)
5. Token validated on each request

### Input Validation

```typescript
// Example of input validation
const validateWalletAddress = (
  address: string,
  type: "BTC" | "ETH"
): boolean => {
  if (type === "BTC") {
    return /^[13][a-km-zA-HJ-NP-Z1-9]{25,34}$/.test(address);
  } else {
    return /^0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}$/.test(address);
  }
};
```

## Security Headers

Required security headers:

```typescript
// Example of security headers configuration
app.use(
  helmet({
    contentSecurityPolicy: {
      directives: {
        defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
        scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
        styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
        imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
        connectSrc: ["'self'", "wss:", "https:"],
      },
    },
    referrerPolicy: { policy: "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" },
    frameguard: { action: "deny" },
    hsts: { maxAge: 31536000, includeSubDomains: true, preload: true },
  })
);
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Code Security

- Regular security audits
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code signing
- Secure coding guidelines

### 2. Infrastructure Security

- Regular backups
- Disaster recovery plan
- Monitoring and alerting
- Access control and logging

### 3. Development Security

- Secure development environment
- Code review process
- Security testing
- CI/CD security

### 4. Operational Security

- Incident response plan
- Security training
- Access management
- Audit logging
